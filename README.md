# Harrison_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project	Summary:

  This project is designed to build and then play the page turner type make your own path games.  When the program opens it will   prompt you to begin making a game, and will include options to then build off of the first location with up to 2 options.       There will also be controls to navigate back up through already constructed paths in order to go and build off other paths.     Once the game is completed to the users satisfaction there will be the option to have a player start and play through the       game.  On exit of the program a text file with the contents of the game will be produced.  There will also be one pre built     game already in the program.
