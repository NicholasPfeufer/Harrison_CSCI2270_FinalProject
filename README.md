# Harrison_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project	Summary:

  This project is designed to build and then play the page turner type make your own path games.  When the program opens it will   prompt you to begin making a game, and will include options to then build off of the first location with up to 2 options.       There will also be controls to navigate back up through already constructed paths in order to go and build off other paths.     Once the game is completed to the users satisfaction there will be the option to have a player start and play through the       game.  On exit of the program a text file with the contents of the game will be produced.  There will also be one pre built     game already in the program.

How	to	Run:

  Download and then compile all three files, then run PageTurner.cpp. You can also downlaod the FinalProectv7"with comments".zip and run the codeblocks project file in your virtual machine. When you run the program you can press "1" to play the pre-built game as an example. Press "2" to make your own page turner. Note, tree nodes serve as the text that will be displayed so some strategy is needed when building a complex story. Press "3" to play your custom made game. Enjoy!

Dependencies:

  JSON library, vector library, queue library all requried to run. We advize the program is run in CodeBlocks as a CodeBlock project file is provided.

System	Requirements:

  System needs to be able to run C++ .cpp and .h files.

Open	issues/bugs:
